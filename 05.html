  <h2>Workouts at the Gym</h2>
  <h3>2021 May 05</h3>

  <p>As a fitness trainer, I meet people who work out for various reasons. Lots of people exercise to <strong>shed weight</strong>, but many others have differnt reasons. Some people feel they are too skinny, so they want to bulk up by increasing <strong>muscle mass</strong>. Many older people begin exercising <strong>on their doctor's orders</strong> to recover from illness.</p>

  <p>People who are <strong>first starting out</strong> are so <strong>pumped up</strong> that they often <strong>overdo it</strong>. But few of these people come back to the gym after about two weeks.</p>

  <p><strong>Excessive</strong> exercise will leave you <strong>feeling sore</strong>. This makes exercise seem like a painful memory. It makes people want to avoid the gym. Their <strong>determination</strong> to exercise becomes <strong>short-lived</strong>. It's best to <strong>take it slow and steady</strong>, exercising at an <strong>appropriate</strong> level.</p>
