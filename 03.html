  <h2>Changes in Wedding Culture</h2>
  <h3>2021 May 03</h3>
  <img src="03_wedding.jpg" width="550">
  <p>The culture of weddings in Korea is changing dramatically these days.
  In the past, inviting lots of guests for a <strong>lavish</strong> wedding was <strong>the norm</strong>.
  But <u>ever since</u> a few years ago, more people have been choosing small weddings.
  Only family, relatives, and close acquaintances are invited to these weddings.</p>

  <p>Measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19 have upped the pace for these changes in wedding customs.
  Even when the crisis <strong>comes to and end</strong>, these changes will <u>likely</u> continue.
  It's because <strong>people's views on</strong> weddings themselves have begun to change.</p>

  <p><strong>The true meaning of</strong> a wedding is to tell people that you will be spending the rest of your life with your <strong>spouse</strong>, and to be congratulated.
  But more and more people don't think it is necessary to spend a lot of time and money just for one day.</p>
